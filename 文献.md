Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are inherently limited to model geometric transformations due to the fixed geometric structures in their building modules. In this work, we introduce two new modules to enhance the transformation modeling capability of CNNs, namely, deformable convolution and deformable RoI pooling.可变形卷积和可变形池化。
It adds 2D offsets to the regular grid sampling locations in the standard convolution. It enables free form deformation of the sampling grid. It is illustrated in Figure 1. The offsets are learned from the preceding feature maps, via additional convolutional layers. Thus, the deformation is conditioned on the input features in a local, dense, and adaptive manner.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92596875/202897667-d8b4fc09-765c-4ccb-af7b-aea521effe30.png)
